\apidescription{

The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy} routine is a collective operation that
destroys the team referenced by the team handle argument \VAR{team}.
Upon return, the referenced team is invalid.

This routine destroys all shareable contexts created from the
referenced team.  The user is responsible for destroying all contexts
created from this team with the \CONST{SHMEM\_CTX\_PRIVATE} option
enabled prior to calling this routine; otherwise, the behavior is
undefined.

It is an error to free the default team or any other predefined team.

When \VAR{team} specifies an invalid team, if \VAR{team} compares
equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}, then no operation is
performed; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
