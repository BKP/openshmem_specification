\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy} routine destroys an existing team. This is a
collective call, in which every member of the team being destroyed needs
to participate. This will free all internal resources associated
with the team. Upon return, the team
handle can no longer be used for team API calls.

It is considered erroneous to free \LibHandleRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD} or
any other predefined team.

When \VAR{team} specifies an invalid team, if \VAR{team} compares
equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}, then no operation is
performed; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Team destruction assumes that any resources explicitly created from the team,
such as contexts created from the team, have already been released through
the appropriate function, such as destroying the context. If there are any
objects or resources explicitly created from the team that have not been
explicitly released before \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy} is called, behavior is
undefined.
