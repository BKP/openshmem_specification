\apidescription{ 
    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine ensures completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO},
    memory store, and non-blocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines on
    symmetric data objects issued by the calling \ac{PE}. All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO},
    memory store, and non-blocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines to
    symmetric data objects are guaranteed to be completed and visible to all
    \acp{PE} when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns.

\apinotes{ 
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is most useful as a way of ensuring completion of
    several \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, memory store, and non-blocking \PUT{}
    and \GET{} routines to symmetric data objects initiated by the calling
    \ac{PE}.  For example, you might use \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to await delivery
    of a block of data before issuing another \PUT{} or non-blocking
    \PUT{} routine, which sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.
     \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is not usually needed if
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} or \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier
    routines wait for the completion of outstanding writes (\PUT{}, \ac{AMO},
    memory stores, and nonblocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines) to
    symmetric data objects on all \acp{PE}.

    \newtext{In a multithreaded \openshmem{} program, the user is responsible to
    ensure the order in which writes (\PUT{}, \ac{AMO}, memory stores, and
    nonblocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines) are issued by all the threads. If
    the user intends to complete operations issued by a \ac{PE} with a
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} call, the user may have to call thread package specific
    synchronizing operation among the threads, i.e., when using pthreads, the
    user may call \FUNC{pthread\_thread\_init} and
    \FUNC{pthread\_barrier\_wait}, before having one thread call
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}. A memory store is considered issued, if the value
    updated by memory store  is visible to the thread calling
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}.}

    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} does not have an effect on the ordering between memory 
    accesses issued by the target PE. \FUNC{shmem\_wait}, \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until}, \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}, 
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} routines can be called by the target PE to guarantee 
    ordering of its memory accesses.
