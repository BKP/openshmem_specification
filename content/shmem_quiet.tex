    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine ensures completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO},
    memory store, \newtext{and non-blocking \PUT{} and \GET{}} routines on
    symmetric data objects issued by the calling \ac{PE}. All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO},
    memory store, \newtext{and non-blocking \PUT{} and \GET{}} routines to
    symmetric data objects are guaranteed to be completed and visible to all
    \acp{PE} when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns.

\apinotes{ 
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is most useful as a way of ensuring completion of
    several \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, memory store, \newtext{and non-blocking \PUT{}
    and \GET{}} routines to symmetric data objects initiated by the calling
    \ac{PE}.  For example, you might use \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to await delivery
    of a block of data before issuing another \PUT{} \newtext{or non-blocking
    \PUT{}} routine, which sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.
     \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is not usually needed if
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} or \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier
    routines wait for the completion of outstanding writes (\PUT{}, \ac{AMO},
    memory stores, \newtext{and nonblocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines}) to
    symmetric data objects on all \acp{PE}.

\newtext{
    The visibility ordering of updates to data and flag at a target \ac{PE} can
    also be affected by memory load reordering at the target \ac{PE} on
    platforms with a relaxed memory model. For example, one might use
    \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to complete the update to a block of data on a target
    \ac{PE} before issuing another \PUT{} routine, which sets a completion flag
    on the same target \ac{PE}. In this case, the target \ac{PE} may still see
    updates to data and flag out of order due to reordering of memory loads on
    the target \ac{PE}. A memory barrier or load-acquire instruction may be
    required between loads at the target \ac{PE} to prevent such reordering. It
    is recommended that \FUNC{shmem\_wait} or \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until} is used
    instead of memory loads to poll on a flag variable at the target \ac{PE} to
    portably guarantee visibility ordering between updates to data and flag at
    the target \ac{PE}.
