\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_2d} routine is a collective routine. It creates two
new teams by splitting an existing parent team into up to two subsets based on a
2D Cartesian space. The user provides the size of the \VAR{x} dimension, which is then
used to derive the size of the \VAR{y} dimension based on the size of the parent team.
The size of the \VAR{y} dimension will be equal to $\lceil N \div xrange \rceil$, where
\VAR{N} is the size of the parent team. In other words,
$xrange \times yrange \geq N$, so that every \ac{PE} in the parent team has a
unique \VAR{(x,y)} location the 2D Cartesian space.

The mapping of \ac{PE} number to coordinates is $(x, y) = ( pe \mod xrange, \lfloor pe \div xrange \rfloor )$,
where $pe$ is the \ac{PE} number in the parent team. So, if $xrange = 3$,
then the first 3 \acp{PE} in the parent team will form the first
\VAR{xteam}, the second three \acp{PE} in the parent team form the second \VAR{xteam},
and so on.

Thus, after the split operation, each of the new \VAR{xteam}s will contain all \acp{PE} that
have the same coordinate along the \VAR{y}-axis as the calling \ac{PE}. Each of the
new \VAR{yteam}s will contain all \acp{PE} with the same coordinate along the
\VAR{x}-axis as the calling \ac{PE}.

The \acp{PE} are numbered in the new teams based on the coordinate of the
\ac{PE} along the given axis. So, another way to think of the result of the split
operation is that the value returned by \FUNC{shmem\_team\_my\_pe(\VAR{xteam})} is the
x-coordinate and the value returned by \FUNC{shmem\_team\_my\_pe(\VAR{yteam})}
is the y-coordinate of the calling \ac{PE}.

Any valid \openshmem team can be used as the parent team. This routine must be
called by all \acp{PE} in the parent team. The value of \VAR{xrange} must be
nonnegative and all \acp{PE} in the parent team must pass the same value for
\VAR{xrange}. None of the parameters need to reside in symmetric memory.

The \VAR{xaxis\_config} and \VAR{yaxis\_config} arguments specify team
configuration parameters for the \VAR{x}- and \VAR{y}-axis teams, respectively.
These parameters are described in Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t}.
All \acp{PE} that will be in the same resultant team must specify the same
configuration parameters.
The \acp{PE} in the parent team \emph{do not} have to all provide the same
parameters for new teams.

The \VAR{xaxis\_mask} and \VAR{yaxis\_mask} arguments are a bitwise masks
representing the set of configuration parameters to use from
\VAR{xaxis\_config} and \VAR{yaxis\_config}, respectively.
A mask value of \CONST{0} indicates that the team
should be created with the default values for all configuration parameters.
See Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t} for field mask names and
default configuration parameters.

If \VAR{parent\_team} is an invalid team handle, the behavior is undefined.

If \VAR{parent\_team} compares equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}, no new
teams will be created, and both \VAR{xaxis\_team} and \VAR{yaxis\_team}
will be assigned the value \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.

If either team cannot be created, that team will be assigned the value
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  Zero on successful creation of both \VAR{xaxis\_team} and \VAR{yaxis\_team},
  nonzero otherwise.
}

\apinotes{
Since the split may result in a 2D space with more points than there are members of
the parent team, there may be a final, incomplete row of the 2D mapping of the parent
team. This means that the resultant \VAR{yteam}s may vary in size by up to 1 \ac{PE},
and that there may be one resultant \VAR{xteam} of smaller size than all of the other
\VAR{xteam}s.

The following grid shows the 12 teams that would result from splitting a parent team
of size 10 with \VAR{xrange} of 3. The numbers in the grid cells are the \ac{PE} numbers
in the parent team. The rows are the \VAR{xteam}s. The columns are the \VAR{yteam}s.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
 \hline
             & yteam & yteam & yteam \\
             & x=0 & x=1 & x=2  \\ \hline
 xteam, y=0  & 0   & 1   & 2  \\ \hline
 xteam, y=1  & 3   & 4   & 5  \\ \hline
 xteam, y=2  & 6   & 7   & 8  \\ \hline
 xteam, y=3  & 9  \\
 \cline{0-1}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It would be legal, for example, if \acp{PE} 0, 3, 6, 9 specified a different value
for \VAR{yaxis\_config} than all of the other \acp{PE}, as long as the configuration parameters match
for all \acp{PE} in each of the new teams.

See the description of team handles and predefined teams at the top of section
\ref{subsec:team} for more information about team handle semantics and usage.
