\TableIndex{Environment Variables}

The \openshmem specification provides a set of environment variables that allows
users to configure the \openshmem implementation, and receive information about
the implementation. The implementations of the specification are free to define
additional variables. Currently, the specification defines four environment
variables. All environment variables that start with \VAR{SMA\_*} are
deprecated, but currently supported for backwards compatibility.
If both \VAR{SHMEM\_}- and \VAR{SMA\_}-prefixed environment variables
are set, then the value in the \VAR{SHMEM\_}-prefixed environment variable
establishes the controlling value. Refer to the
\hyperref[subsec:deprecate-sma-env]{\VAR{SMA\_*} Environment Variables}
deprecation rationale for more details.

\hline
\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}
\tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_VERSION}
    & Any
    & Print the library version at start-up
    \tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_INFO}
    & Any
    & Print helpful text about all these environment variables
    \tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE}
    & Non-negative integer
    & Controls the size of the symmetric heap per \ac{PE}. The value
      set in this environment variable is interpreted as number
      of bytes, unless the number is followed by a single
      character that acts as a multiplier, where:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item k or K multiplies by \(2^{10}\)  (kilobytes)
        \item m or M multiplies by \(2^{20}\)  (megabytes)
        \item g or G multiplies by \(2^{30}\)  (gigabytes)
      \end{itemize}
      For example, the string 20m is equivalent to the integer value 20971520,
      or 20 megabytes. Only one multiplier is recognized, so 20kk
      will not produce the same value as 20m, nor will invalid
      strings such as 20MB produce the desired result.

\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_DEBUG}
    & Any
    & Enable debugging messages
