\apidescription{
    This routine assures ordering of delivery of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory
    store routines to symmetric data objects.  All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory
    store routines to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote
    \ac{PE} prior to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be
    delivered before any subsequent \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines
    to symmetric data objects to the same \ac{PE}. \FUNC{shmem\_fence}
    guarantees order of delivery, not completion.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} only provides per-\ac{PE} ordering guarantees and does
    not guarantee completion of delivery.  There is a subtle difference between
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} and \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, in that, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}
    guarantees completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to
    symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other
    \acp{PE}. 
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine should be called if completion of PUT{},
    \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data objects is desired
    when multiple remote \ac{PE}s are involved.

    \newtext{
    The visibility ordering of updates at a target PE can also be affected by
    memory load reordering at the target \ac{PE} on platforms with a relaxed
    memory model.  For example, one might use \FUNC{shmem\_fence} to order
    delivery of a block of data to a target \ac{PE} before issuing another
    \PUT{} routine, which sets a completion flag on the same target \ac{PE}. In
    this case, the target \ac{PE} may still see updates to data and flag out of
    order due to reordering of memory loads on the target \ac{PE}. A memory
    barrier or load-acquire instruction may be required between loads at the
    target \ac{PE} to prevent such reordering. It is recommended that
    \FUNC{shmem\_wait} or \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until} is used instead of memory
    loads to poll on a flag variable at the target \ac{PE} to portably guarantee
    visibility ordering between updates to data and flag at the target \ac{PE}.
