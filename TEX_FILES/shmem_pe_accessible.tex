       Determines whether a processing element (PE) is accessible via OpenSHMEM's data transfer operations.

SYNOPSIS
       C/C++:

	  int shmem_pe_accessible(int pe);

       Fortran:

	  LOGICAL LOG, SHMEM_PE_ACCESSIBLE

	  INTEGER pe

	  LOG = SHMEM_PE_ACCESSIBLE(pe)

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

	IN pe	Specific pe that needs to be checked if accessible from the local PE.

API Description

       shmem_pe_accessible is  a  query	 function  that	 indicates  whether  a
       specified PE is accessible via OpenSHMEM from the local PE.

       On  SGI	Altix  series  systems,	 SHMEM	is  supported  across multiple
       partitioned hosts and InfiniBand connected hosts.

       When running multiple executable MPI applications using SHMEM on Altix,
       full SHMEM support is available between processes running from the same
       executable file.	 However, SHMEM support between processes of different
       executable  files  is  supported only for data objects on the symmetric
       heap, since static data objects are  not	 symmetric  between  different
       executable  files.   The	 shmem_pe_accessible function on Altix returns
       TRUE only if  the  remote  PE  is  a  process  running  from  the  same
       executable  file	 as  the  local PE, indicating that full SHMEM support
       (static memory and symmetric heap) is available.

Return Value

       C:	 The return value is 1 if the specified PE is a	 valid	remote
		 PE for SHMEM functions; otherwise,it is 0.

       Fortran:	 The  return  value  is	 .TRUE. if the specified PE is a valid
		 remote PE for SHMEM functions; otherwise, it is .FALSE..
