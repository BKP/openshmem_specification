       shmem\_pe\_accessible is  a  query function  that indicates  whether  a
       specified PE is accessible via OpenSHMEM from the local PE.

       For example, on  SGI	Altix  series  systems, OpenSHMEM	is  supported  across multiple
       partitioned hosts and InfiniBand connected hosts.

       When running multiple executable MPI applications using OpenSHMEM on an Altix,
       full OpenSHMEM support is available between processes running from the same
       executable file.	 However, SHMEM support between processes of different
       executable  files  is  supported only for data objects on the symmetric
       heap, since static data objects are  not symmetric  between  different
       executable  files.   The shmem\_pe\_accessible function on Altix returns
       TRUE only if  the  remote  PE  is  a  process  running  from  the  same
       executable  file	 as  the  local PE, indicating that full OpenSHMEM support
       (static memory and symmetric heap) is available.
