       Assures ordering of delivery of puts.

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  void shmem_fence(void);

       Fortran:

	  CALL SHMEM_FENCE

DESCRIPTION

Arguments
 
	None.

API Description

       This  function ensures ordering of put (remote write) operations.   All
       put operations issued to a particular remote  processing	 element  (PE)
       prior  to the call to shmem_fence are guaranteed to be delivered before
       any subsequent put operations to the same PE which follow the  call  to
       shmem_fence.

Return Value

	None.

NOTES
       The  shmem_quiet	 function  should  be  called  if  ordering of puts is
       desired when multiple remote PEs are involved.

EXAMPLE
       The following shmem_fence example is for C/C++ programs:

	\lstinputlisting[language=C]{shmem_fence_example.c}

        Put1 will be delivered before put3 and put2 will be delivered before put4.
