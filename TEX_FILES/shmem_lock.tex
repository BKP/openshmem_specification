   \argRow{IN}{lock}{	 A symmetric data object that is a scalar variable or an array
		 of  length  1. This	data  object  must  be set to 0 on all
		 processing elements (PEs) prior to the first use.  lock  must

{
       The shmem\_set\_lock routine sets a mutual exclusion lock after  waiting
       for  the lock  to be freed by any other PE currently holding the lock.
       Waiting PEs  are  assured  of  getting	the  lock  in  a   first-come,
       first-served manner.The   shmem\_clear\_lock  routine releases  a  lock  previously  set  by
       shmem\_set\_lock  after  ensuring that  all  local  and  remote	stores
       initiated in the critical region are complete. The shmem\_test\_lock function sets a mutual exclusion lock only if it is
       currently cleared.  By using this function, a PE can avoid blocking  on
       a set lock.  If the lock is currently set, the function returns without
       waiting. These routines are appropriate for protecting a critical  region  from
       simultaneous  update  by multiple  PEs.

\desR{
       The shmem\_test\_lock function returns  0	if  the lock  was  originally
       cleared and  this  call was  able  to set the lock.  A value of 1 is
       returned if the lock had been set and the call returned without waiting
       to set the lock.}
