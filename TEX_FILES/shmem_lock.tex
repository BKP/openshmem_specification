       Releases, locks, and tests a mutual exclusion memory lock

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  void shmem_clear_lock(long *lock);

	  void shmem_set_lock(long *lock);

	  int shmem_test_lock(long *lock);

       Fortran:

	  INTEGER lock, SHMEM_TEST_LOCK

	  CALL SHMEM_CLEAR_LOCK(lock)

	  CALL SHMEM_SET_LOCK(lock)

	  I = SHMEM_TEST_LOCK(lock)

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

       IN	lock	 A symmetric data object that is a scalar variable or an array
		 of  length  1.	  This	data  object  must  be set to 0 on all
		 processing elements (PEs) prior to the first use.  lock  must
		 be  of	 type  long.   If you are using Fortran, it must be of
		 default kind.

API Description

       The shmem_set_lock routine sets a mutual exclusion lock	after  waiting
       for  the	 lock  to be freed by any other PE currently holding the lock.
       Waiting	PEs  are  assured  of  getting	the  lock  in  a   first-come,
       first-served manner.

       The   shmem_clear_lock  routine	releases  a  lock  previously  set  by
       shmem_set_lock  after  ensuring	that  all  local  and  remote	stores
       initiated in the critical region are complete.

       The shmem_test_lock function sets a mutual exclusion lock only if it is
       currently cleared.  By using this function, a PE can avoid blocking  on
       a set lock.  If the lock is currently set, the function returns without
       waiting.

       These routines are appropriate for protecting a	critical  region  from
       simultaneous  update  by	 multiple  PEs.	  

Return Value

       The shmem_test_lock function returns  0	if  the	 lock  was  originally
       cleared	and  this  call	 was  able  to	set the lock.  A value of 1 is
       returned if the lock had been set and the call returned without waiting
       to set the lock.

NOTES
       The term symmetric data object is defined in Introduction.
