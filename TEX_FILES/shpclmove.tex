%API description
 {       The SHPCLMOVE function either extends a symmetric  heap	block  if  the
       block  is  followed by a large enough free block or copies the contents
       of the existing block to a larger  block	 and  returns  a  status  code
       indicating that the block was moved.  This function also can reduce the
       size of a block if the new length is less than  the  old	 length.   All
       \ac{PE}s  in a program must call SHPCLMOVE with the
       same value of addr to maintain symmetric heap consistency; if  any  \ac{PE}s
       are missing, the program hangs.
