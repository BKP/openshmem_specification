       Extends  a symmetric heap block or copies the contents of
       the block into a larger block.

SYNOPSIS
       POINTER (addr, A(1))
       INTEGER length, status, abort
       CALL SHPCLMOVE (addr, length, status, abort)

DESCRIPTION
       The SHPCLMOVE function either extends a symmetric  heap	block  if  the
       block  is  followed by a large enough free block or copies the contents
       of the existing block to a larger  block	 and  returns  a  status  code
       indicating that the block was moved.  This function also can reduce the
       size of a block if the new length is less than  the  old	 length.   All
       processing  elements  (PEs)  in	a program must call SHPCLMOVE with the
       same value of addr to maintain symmetric heap consistency; if  any  PEs
       are missing, the program hangs.

       The SHPCLMOVE function accepts the following arguments:

       Argument	      Description
       addr	      On  entry, first word address of the block to change; on
		      exit, the new address of the block if it was moved.
       length	      Requested new total length in words (input).   One  word
		      is 32 bits.
       status	      Status  is 0 if the block was extended in place, 1 if it
		      was moved, and a negative integer for the type of	 error
		      detected (output).
       abort	      Abort code.  Nonzero requests abort on error; 0 requests
		      an error code (input).

RETURN VALUES
       Error conditions are as follows:

       Code	      Condition
       -1	      Length is not an integer greater than 0.
       -2	      No more memory is available from the system (checked  if
		      the  block  cannot  be  extended and the free space list
		      does not include a large enough block).
       -3	      Address is outside the bounds of the symmetric heap.
       -4	      Block is already free.
       -5	      Address is not at the beginning of a block.
