       Called  at the beginning of a SHMEM program to initialize
       the execution environment.

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  void start_pes(int npes);

       Fortran:

	  CALL START_PES(npes)

DESCRIPTION
       The start_pes routine should be the first statement in a SHMEM parallel
       program.

       The start_pes routine accepts the following argument:

       npes	 Unused.  Should be set to 0.


EXAMPLES
       This is a simple program that calls shmem_integer_put():

	     PROGRAM PUT

	     INTEGER TARG, SRC, RECEIVER, BAR
	     COMMON /T/ TARG
	     PARAMETER (RECEIVER=1)
	     CALL START_PES(0)

	     IF (MY_PE() .EQ. 0) THEN
		 SRC = 33
		 CALL SHMEM_INTEGER_PUT(TARG, SRC, 1, RECEIVER)
	     ENDIF

	     CALL SHMEM_BARRIER_ALL	      ! SYNCHRONIZES SENDER AND RECEIVER

	     IF (MY_PE() .EQ. RECEIVER) THEN
		 PRINT*,'PE ', MY_PE(),' TARG=',TARG,' (expect 33)'
	     ENDIF
	     END


NOTES
       If  the	start_pes  call	 is  not  the  first  statement	 in a program,
       unexpected results may occur on some architectures.
