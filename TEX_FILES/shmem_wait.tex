DESCRIPTION

Arguments

	OUT       ivar    A remotely accessible integer variable that is being updated by
	       another PE.  If you are using C/C++, the type  of  ivar	should
	       match  that  implied in the SYNOPSIS section.  If you are using
	       Fortran, ivar must be a specific sized integer  type  according
	       to the function being called, as follows:

	       Function			Type of ivar

	       shmem_wait
	       shmem_wait_until		default INTEGER

	       shmem_int4_wait
	       shmem_int4_wait_until	INTEGER*4

	       shmem_int8_wait
	       shmem_int8_wait_until	INTEGER*8

       IN	cmp     The  compare  operator  that compares ivar with cmp_value.  cmp
	       must be of type integer.	 If you are using Fortran, it must  be
	       of  default  kind.   If	you  are  using C/C++, the type of cmp
	       should  match  that  implied  in	 the  SYNOPSIS	section.   The
	       following cmp values are supported:

	       cmp Value	   Comparison

	       SHMEM_CMP_EQ	   Equal

	       SHMEM_CMP_NE	   Not equal

	       SHMEM_CMP_GT	   Greater than

	       SHMEM_CMP_LE	   Less than or equal to

	       SHMEM_CMP_LT	   Less than

	       SHMEM_CMP_GE	   Greater than or equal to

       IN	cmp_value
	       cmp_value must be of type integer.  If you are using C/C++, the
	       type of cmp_value should match that  implied  in	 the  SYNOPSIS
	       section.	  If  you  are	using  Fortran,	 cmp_value  must be an
	       integer of the same size and kind as ivar.

API Description

       shmem_wait and shmem_wait_until wait for ivar to be changed by a remote
       write or atomic swap issued by a different processor.   These  routines
       can  be	used  for  point-to-point directed synchronization.  A call to
       shmem_wait does not return until some other processor writes  a	value,
       not  equal to cmp_value, into ivar on the waiting processor.  A call to
       shmem_wait_until does not return until  some  other  processor  changes
       ivar  to	 satisfy  the  condition  implied  by cmp and cmp_value.  This
       mechanism is useful when a processor needs to  tell  another  processor
       that it has completed some action.

       The shmem_wait  routines	 return	 when  ivar  is	 no  longer  equal  to
       cmp_value.

       The  shmem_wait_until  routines	return	when  the compare condition is
       true.  The compare condition is defined by the ivar  argument  compared
       with the cmp_value using the comparison operator, cmp.

Return Value

	None.

EXAMPLES
       Example	1:  The following call returns when variable ivar is not equal
       to 100:

       \lstinputlisting[language=C]{shmem_wait1_example.f90}

       Example 2:  The following call to SHMEM_INT8_WAIT_UNTIL	is  equivalent
       to the call to SHMEM_INT8_WAIT in example 1:

       \lstinputlisting[language=C]{shmem_wait2_example.f90}

       Example	3:   The following C/C++ call waits until the sign bit in ivar
       is set by a transfer from a remote PE:

       \lstinputlisting[language=C]{shmem_wait3_example.f90}

       Example 4:  The following Fortran example is in the context of a
       subroutine:

	\lstinputlisting[language=C]{shmem_wait4_example.c}
