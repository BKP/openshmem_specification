%API description
 { 
 The shmem\_quiet routine ensures ordering of put (remote write) operations.  All put operations  issued  to any \ac{PE} prior to the call to shmem\_quiet are guaranteed to be visible to all other \ac{PE}s no later than any   subsequent	  memory   load	 or  store,  remote  put  or  get,  or synchronization operations that follow the call to shmem\_quiet.

\notesB{ 
       shmem\_quiet is most useful as a way of ensuring ordering of delivery of
       several put  operations. For example,  you might use shmem\_quiet to
       await delivery of a block of data before issuing  another  put, which
       sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.

       shmem\_quiet is not	usually needed  if   \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}  or
        \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier routines  all wait  for  the
       completion of outstanding remote writes (puts).
