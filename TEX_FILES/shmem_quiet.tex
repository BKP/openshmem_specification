%API description
 { 
 The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine ensures completion of \PUT{} operations (remote write) and \ac{AMO} and store operations on 
 symmetric data issued by the calling \ac{PE}.  
 All \PUT{} and \acp{AMO} issued by the local \ac{PE} to any \ac{PE} prior to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} are 
 guaranteed to be visible to all other \ac{PE}s when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns. In addition, when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns, 
 the local store operations are expected to be completed.  
 %SP: Removing confusing parts as according to SGI they are complete at the end of quiet.
 %no later than any subsequent memory load or 
 %store, \PUT{}  or  \GET{}, \acp{AMO},  or synchronization operations that follow the call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}.

% Notes. If there are no notes, this field can be left empty.
\notesB{ 
       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is most useful as a way of ensuring delivery of
       several \PUT{} and \ac{AMO} operations. For example,  you might use \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to
       await delivery of a block of data before issuing  another \PUT{}, which
       sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.

       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is not usually needed if \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}  or
        \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier routines  all wait  for  the
       completion of outstanding remote writes (\PUT{} and \ac{AMO}).
       
       In the case of cache-coherent systems, the local store operations are eventually
       reflected in the memory without any explicit \openshmem{} calls. However, to ensure the store 
       operations are completed when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns, the implementations might have to issue an explicit memory 
       barrier.
