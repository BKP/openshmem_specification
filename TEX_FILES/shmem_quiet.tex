       Waits  for  completion of all outstanding remote writes
       issued by a processing element (PE).

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  void shmem_quiet(void);

       Fortran:

	  CALL SHMEM_QUIET

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

	None.

API Description

       shmem_quiet ensures ordering of put (remote write) operations.  All put
       operations  issued  to any processing element (PE) prior to the call to
       shmem_quiet are guaranteed to be visible to all other PEs no later than
       any   subsequent	  memory   load	 or  store,  remote  put  or  get,  or
       synchronization operations that follow the call to shmem_quiet.

Return Value

	None.

NOTES
       shmem_quiet is most useful as a way of ensuring ordering of delivery of
       several	put  operations.   For	example,  you might use shmem_quiet to
       await delivery of a block of data before	 issuing  another  put,	 which
       sets a completion flag on another PE.

       shmem_quiet   is	  not	usually	  needed  if  shmem_barrier_all()  or
       shmem_barrier() are called.  The barrier routines  all	wait  for  the
       completion of outstanding remote writes (puts).

EXAMPLES

	The  following  simple  example	uses  shmem_quiet  in a Fortran
       program.
