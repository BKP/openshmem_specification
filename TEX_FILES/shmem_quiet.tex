%API description
 { 
 The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine ensures completion of \PUT{} operations (remote write), \acp{AMO} and store operations on symmetric data issued by the calling \ac{PE}. All \PUT{} and \acp{AMO} issued by the local \ac{PE} to any \ac{PE} prior to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} are guaranteed to be visible to all other \ac{PE}s when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns. In addition, when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns, all store operations issued by the calling \ac{PE } on symmetric data are expected to be completed.  
 %SP: Removing confusing parts as according to SGI they are complete at the end of quiet.
 %no later than any subsequent memory load or 
 %store, \PUT{}  or  \GET{}, \acp{AMO},  or synchronization operations that follow the call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}.

\notesB{ 
       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is most useful as a way of ensuring delivery of
       several \PUT{} and \ac{AMO} operations initiated by the calling \ac{PE}. For example,  you might use \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to await delivery of a block of data before issuing  another \PUT{}, which
       sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.

       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is not usually needed if \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}  or
        \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier routines  all wait  for  the
       completion of outstanding remote writes (\PUT{} and \ac{AMO}) to symmetric data objects on all \acp{PE}.
