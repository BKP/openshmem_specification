       Performs an atomic swap to a
       remote data object

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  double shmem_double_swap(double *target, double value, int pe);

	  float shmem_float_swap(float *target, float value, int pe);

	  int shmem_int_swap(int *target, int value, int pe);

	  long shmem_long_swap(long *target, long value, int pe);

	  long long shmem_longlong_swap(long long *target,  long  long	value,
	  int pe);

	  long shmem_swap(long *target, long value, int pe);

       Fortran:

	  INTEGER pe

	  INTEGER SHMEM_SWAP
	  ires = SHMEM_SWAP(target, value, pe)

	  INTEGER(KIND=4) SHMEM_INT4_SWAP
	  ires = SHMEM_INT4_SWAP(target, value, pe)

	  INTEGER(KIND=8) SHMEM_INT8_SWAP
	  ires = SHMEM_INT8_SWAP(target, value, pe)

	  REAL(KIND=4) SHMEM_REAL4_SWAP
	  res = SHMEM_REAL4_SWAP(target, value, pe)

	  REAL(KIND=8) SHMEM_REAL8_SWAP
	  res = SHMEM_REAL8_SWAP(target, value, pe)

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

	OUT       target	 The  remotely accessible integer data object to be updated on
		 the remote PE.	 If you are using C/C++, the  type  of	target
		 should	 match	that  implied in the SYNOPSIS section.	If you
		 are using Fortran, it must be of the following type:

		      Routine		       Data Type

		      SHMEM_SWAP	       Integer of default kind

		      SHMEM_INT4_SWAP	       4-byte integer

		      SHMEM_INT8_SWAP	       8-byte integer

		      SHMEM_REAL4_SWAP	       4-byte real

		      SHMEM_REAL8_SWAP	       8-byte real

       IN	value	 Value to be atomically written to the remote  PE.   value  is
		 the same type as target.

       IN	pe	 An integer that indicates the PE number on which target is to
		 be updated.  If you are using Fortran, it must be  a  default
		 integer value.

API Description

       shmem_swap  performs  an	 atomic	 swap operation. It writes value value
       into target on processing element (PE)  pe  and	returns	 the  previous
       contents of target as an atomic operation.

Return Values

       The contents that had been at the target address on the remote PE prior
       to the swap is returned.

NOTES
       The term remotely accessible is defined in the Introduction.

EXAMPLES

	The  following  simple  example uses  shmem_long_swap  in a C program.
