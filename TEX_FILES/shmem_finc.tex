       Performs an atomic fetch-and-increment  operation
       on a remote data object.

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  int shmem_int_finc(int *target, int pe);

	  long shmem_long_finc(long *target, int pe);

	  long long shmem_longlong_finc(long long *target, int pe);

       Fortran:

	  INTEGER pe

	  INTEGER(KIND=4) SHMEM_INT4_FINC, target4

	  INTEGER(KIND=8) SHMEM_INT8_FINC, target8

	  ires4 = SHMEM_INT4_FINC(target4, pe)

	  ires8 = SHMEM_INT8_FINC(target8, pe)

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

	IN       target	 The  remotely accessible integer data object to be updated on
		 the remote PE.	 The type of target should match that  implied
		 in the SYNOPSIS section.

       IN	pe	 An integer that indicates the PE number on which target is to
		 be updated. If you are using Fortran, it must	be  a  default
		 integer value.
API Description

       These functions perform a fetch-and-increment operation.	 The target on
       processing element (PE) pe is increased by one and the function returns
       the previous contents of target as an atomic operation.

Return Value

       The contents that had been at the target address on the remote PE prior
       to the increment. The data type of the return value is the same as the target.
