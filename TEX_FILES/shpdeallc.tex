       Returns a memory block to the symmetric heap

SYNOPSIS
       POINTER (addr, A(1))
       INTEGER errcode, abort
       CALL SHPDEALLC(addr, errcode, abort)

DESCRIPTION
       SHPDEALLC  returns  a block of memory (allocated using SHPALLOC) to the
       list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To  maintain  symmetric
       heap  consistency, all processing elements (PEs) in a program must call
       SHPDEALLC with the same value of addr; if  any  PEs  are	 missing,  the
       program hangs.

       The SHPDEALLC function accepts the following arguments:

       Argument	      Description
       addr	      First word address of the block to deallocate (input).
       errcode	      Error  code is 0 if no error was detected; otherwise, it
		      is a  negative  integer  code  for  the  type  of	 error
		      (output).
       abort	      Abort code.  Nonzero requests abort on error; 0 requests
		      an error code (input).

RETURN VALUES
       Error conditions are as follows:

       Code	      Condition
       -3	      Address is outside the bounds of the symmetric heap.
       -4	      Block is already free.
       -5	      Address is not at the beginning of the block.
