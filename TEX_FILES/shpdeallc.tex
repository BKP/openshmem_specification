%API description
 {
       SHPDEALLC  returns  a block of memory (allocated using SHPALLOC) to the
       list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To  maintain  symmetric
       heap  consistency, all PEs in a program must call
       SHPDEALLC with the same value of addr; if  any  PEs  are	 missing,  the
       program hangs.
  }
 %Return Values     
\desR{       
Error conditions are as follows:

       Code	      Condition
       -3	      Address is outside the bounds of the symmetric heap.
       -4	      Block is already free.
       -5	      Address is not at the beginning of the block.
