\argRow{IN}{target}{The symmetric data object to be referenced.}
\argRow{IN}{pe}{An integer that indicates the PE number on which target is to

{
       shmem\_ptr returns an address that may be used  to  directly  reference
       target on the specified PE.  This address can be assigned to a pointer.
       After that, ordinary loads and stores to this  remote  address  may  be
       performed.

       When a sequence of loads (gets) and stores (puts) to a data object on a
       remote PE does not match the access pattern provided in	a \openshmem data
       transfer routine   like  shmem\_put32()  or  shmem\_real\_iget(),  the
       shmem\_ptr function can provide an efficient  means  to  accomplish  the
       communication.

{
 \desR{shmem\_ptr returns a pointer to the data object on the specified	remote
       PE. If target is not remotely accessible, a NULL pointer is returned.
}
\notesB{The shmem\_ptr function is available  only  on  systems  where  ordinary
       memory  loads  and  stores  are	used  to  implement \openshmem put and get
       operations. When calling shmem\_ptr, you pass the address on the calling	PE  for a symmetric
       array on the remote PE.}
