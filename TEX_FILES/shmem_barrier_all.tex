%API description
{   
    The shmem\_barrier\_all function registers the arrival of a PE at a
    barrier. Barriers are a fast mechanism for synchronizing all PEs at
    once. This routine causes a PE to suspend execution until all PEs have
    called shmem\_barrier\_all. This function must be used with PEs started
    by start\_pes().

    Prior to synchronizing with other PEs, shmem\_barrier\_all ensures
    completion of all previously issued local memory stores and remote
    memory updates issued via shared memory routine calls such as
    shmem\_put32().
