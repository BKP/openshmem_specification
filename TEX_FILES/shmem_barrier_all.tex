Registers  the  arrival of a processing element (PE) at a barrier and suspends PE execution until all other PEs arrive at the barrier and all local and remote memory updates are completed.

SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  void barrier(void);

	  void shmem_barrier_all(void);

       Fortran:

	  CALL BARRIER

	  CALL SHMEM_BARRIER_ALL

DESCRIPTION

Arguments
       None.

API Description

       The  shmem_barrier_all  function	 registers  the	 arrival  of a PE at a
       barrier.	 Barriers are a fast mechanism for synchronizing  all  PEs  at
       once.  This routine causes a PE to suspend execution until all PEs have
       called shmem_barrier_all.  This function must be used with PEs  started
       by start_pes().

       Prior  to  synchronizing	 with  other  PEs,  shmem_barrier_all  ensures
       completion of all previously issued  local  memory  stores  and	remote
       memory	updates	 issued	 via  shared  memory  routine  calls  such  as
       shmem_put32().

Return Value
       None.
