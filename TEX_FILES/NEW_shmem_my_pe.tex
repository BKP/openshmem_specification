SYNOPSIS
       C or C++:

	  int shmem_my_pe(void);

	  int _my_pe (void);

       Fortran:

	  INTEGER SHMEM_MY_PE, ME

	  MYPE = SHMEM_MY_PE()
	  
	  ME = MY_PE ()

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

       None.

API Description

       This function returns the processing element (PE) number of the calling
       PE.   It accepts no arguments.	The result is an integer between 0 and
       npes - 1, where npes is the total number of PEs executing  the  current
       program.

Return Value       
    
       Integer - Between 0 and npes - 1

NOTES
       For OpenSHMEM Specification 1.1 the use of _my_pe() has been deprecated. Although OpenSHMEM libraries are required to support the call, application developers are encouraged to use shmem_my_pe() instead.

EXAMPLES

       The following shmem_my_pe example is for C/C++ programs:
