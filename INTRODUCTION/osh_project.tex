\section{The \openshmem Effort}

\openshmem is a specification that aims at consolidating the different
SHMEM versions provided by vendors, laboratories and universities 
into a single widely accepted specification. There are currently various vendor-specific SHMEM implementations available for
different platforms. These versions have subtle differences from one
another, and generally, code written using any one of these
implementations is not directly portable to the others. Additionally, \openshmem aims
to produce a portable specification enabling programmers to write
\openshmem code that can run on as many different platforms
as possible. To know more about the history of \openshmem, see the section on \hyperref[sec:openshmem_history]{History of \openshmem}.

The \openshmem specification is widely accepted by the community and is the de-facto
standard for SHMEM.  For vendors interested in implementing OpenSHMEM, there is an open source reference implementation
that can serve as a starting point to develop their own libraries or to experiment with extensions. The reference implementation is available at www.openshmem.org.
