%\subsection{What is \openshmem ?}

There are currently various SHMEM implementations available for
different platforms. These versions have subtle differences from one
another, and generally, code written using any one of these
implementations is not directly portable to the others.

\openshmem aims to address this situation by creating a process that
builds a new, open specification to consolidate the various extant
SHMEM versions into a widely accepted standard.

A result of this process will be an initial reference implementation
based on the SGI SHMEM that can serve as a starting point for vendors
and library developers. New features and enhancements can be incorporated
by the community as agreed and desired. Additionally, \openshmem aims
to produce a portable specification enabling programmers to write
SHMEM code that will run with little effort on as many different platforms
as possible.
