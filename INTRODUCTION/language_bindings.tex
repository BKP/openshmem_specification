\section{Language Bindings and Conformance}

%\openshmem is available with \Clang{} and \Fortran{} bindings.  The \Cpp{}
%interface is currently the same as that for \Clang.  An \openshmem implementation can be conformant to one or both of the
%interfaces.  An implementation that provides e.g.\ only a \Clang{} interface may claim to conform to the \openshmem specification with respect to
%the \Clang{} language, but not to \Fortran{} and should make this clear in its documentation.  An implementation that provides both \Clang{} and \Fortran{} bindings may claim
%complete conformance.


\openshmem provides bindings for ISO \Clang{} and \Fortran{} 90 languages. Any
implementation that provide \Clang{} can claim conformance to the specification.

All \openshmem{} functions are prefixed with \shmemprefix{}, except these
functions are expections :
\begin{itemize}
\item start\_pes{}
\item shfree{}
\item shpalloc{}
\item shpclmove{}
\item shpdellc{}
\end{itemize}

The \openshmem{} programs should avoid using function names, variables, or
identifiers with the prefix \shmemprefix{} or above names.
