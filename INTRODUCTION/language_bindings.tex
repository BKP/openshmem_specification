\section{Language Bindings and Conformance}

\openshmem is available with C and Fortran bindings.  The C++
interface is currently the same as that for C.

An \openshmem implementation can be conformant to one or both of the
interfaces.  An implementation that provides e.g.\ only a C interface
may claim to conform to the \openshmem specification with respect to
the C language, but not to Fortran and should make this clear in its
documentation.

An implementation that provides both C and Fortran bindings may claim
complete conformance.
