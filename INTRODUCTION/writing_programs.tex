\section{Writing \openshmem{} Programs}

\subsection*{Incorporating \openshmem{} into Programs}

% C and C++ programs that use the \openshmem library must \texttt{\textbf{}}\lstinline[basicstyle={\ttfamily},language={C++}]!#include <mpp/shmem.h>!.
% Fortran programs should \lstinline[basicstyle={\ttfamily},language=Fortran]!include 'mpp/shmem.fh'!;
% and Fortran programs that use constants defined by \openshmem must
% \lstinline[basicstyle={\ttfamily},language=Fortran]!include 'mpp/shmem.fh'!. 

\Clang{} and \Cpp{} programs that use the \openshmem library \emph{must}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <shmem.h>
\end{lstlisting}

All \Fortran{} \openshmem programs \emph{should}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
include 'shmem.fh'
\end{lstlisting}

and \Fortran{} \openshmem programs that use constants defined by \openshmem
\emph{must}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
include 'shmem.fh'
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Important Compatibility Note}}

Implementations \emph{must} also provide these header files so that
they can be referenced in \Clang{} and \Cpp{} as

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <mpp/shmem.h>
\end{lstlisting}

and in \Fortran{} as

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
include 'mpp/shmem.fh'
\end{lstlisting}

for backward compatbility with OpensHMEM 1.0 and SGI SHMEM.
