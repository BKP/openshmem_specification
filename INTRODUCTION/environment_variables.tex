\section{Environment Variables }

Consistent with the SGI implementation of SHMEM, the \openshmem specification
currently provides a set of environment variables that allows users
to affect run-time behavior:

\medskip{}


\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 
Variable & Value & Function\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
\texttt{SMA\_VERSION} & any & print the library version at start-up\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{SMA\_INFO} & any & print helpful text about all these environment variables\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{SMA\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE} & non-negative integer & number of bytes to allocate for symmetric heap\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{SMA\_DEBUG} & any & enable debugging messages\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

\medskip{}
 

Implementations are free to define their own environment variables.
