%\openshmem{} specification defines various \acp{AMO}.
\ac{AMO} is a one-sided communication mechanism that compbines memory update operations with atomicity gurantees described in Section \ref{sec:amo_guarantees}. 
Similar to the \ac{RMA} operations, described in Section \ref{sec:rma},
the \acp{AMO} are performed only on the symmetric objects. 
\openshmem{} defines the two types of \ac{AMO} operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blocking\\
The \textit{fetch-and-operate} operations combine memory update and fetch 
operations in a single atomic operation.
Fetch-and-operate operations are blocking atomic operation and return as
soon as the fetched is delivered to the initiator of the operation.

The \textit{fetch-and-operate} operations include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_CSWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_SWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_FINC}, and \FUNC{SHMEM\_FADD}.

\item Non-Blocking\\
The \textit{non-fetch} atomic operations update the remote memory 
in a single atomic operations.
The \textit{non-fetch} atomic operations are non-blocking and should return as
soon as the atomic operation is issued.

The \textit{non-fetch} operating include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_INC} and \FUNC{SHMEM\_ADD}.
\end{itemize}
%Fetch-and-operate routines are described in Section \ref{sec:amo_fetch} and non-fetch routines 
%described in Section  \ref{sec:amo_nonfetch}.
%All atomic operations in \openshmem{} are blocking operations.
